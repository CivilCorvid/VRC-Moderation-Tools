# VRC Moderation Tools
 
This tool intends to provide a method to track moderator actions via VRC's game logs.

# Goals:
	1. Web server for log uploading.
	2. Server-based log processing, converting this into a time-sorted list of player actions..
	3. Add easy-upload feature (drag and drop or a PC based program)?
